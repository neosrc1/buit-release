 <button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 1 - REASON STARTS WITH T</button>
<div class="content">
  <pre>The sun is slowly awakening from its slumber.
It first lights up the distant hills, then the ground in front of the hills, and eventually the sun shines wide open into the fields.
Or, at least, what used to be the fields.

The Plains, located in the southern region of Goiky, has been left a giant wasteland.
All landmarks of the area, the Bathrooms, the local Steakhouse, the Swings,
pretty much every structure that was here at some point is crumbling apart, and in some occasions, reduced into nothing but a pile of rubble.
The only thing remaining is a digitized metal sign, which conveys the following message.

"If anyone sees this sign after the events passing here, you are miles too late. Something catastrophic is taking place. You can't stop whatever has began. Not them, at least."
The sign also provides a regularly updating counter, indicating how many years this sign has been standing. It's count is 741.
What happened in order for this region to be abandoned for the rest of time?

At night, a figure approaches the sign. They plug a metal rod into the ground.
They unpack their backpack. Proceeding this, an image of the Plains in its normal state was hung up onto the rod. The figure wrote the year "2022" on it.
They also proceed to attach a sticky note to the image. Written on it: "REST WELL..."
Shortly after, an image of a familiar person was stuck underneath the sticky note. The text on the image header? "Liy".
After a pause, the figure crosses out the image of this person.
All visual evidence beyond this point has been ridden from history.</pre>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 1</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Poof. Wide awake. The first thing you see with your opened eyes is the crown of an oak tree.
As you slowly lift up your body, you see the crowd, consisting of your fellow competitors.
They are having a good time, talking, laughing, doing all sorts of shenanigans.
You can't help but notice what weird situation you are in. A few give you a happy wave, most don't do anything, and the other few turn away.

As you run towards the bathrooms, you see someone walking off to the desert. "Eh, I guess they're going home early.", you think to yourself.
You really might want to do a bathroom break. You go in, and close the door.</pre>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 2 - ORDINARY DAY OF A VENGEFUL PERSON</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Teardrop. A lonely man with a feel of unfulfilledness. Walking down a desert path. On, and on.
He doesn't find this path very exhausting. It takes him until dawn to reach a small house. He unlocks the door.

"Hey Tracy. How was it with the others?" a voice exclaimed. All that Teardrop did was hold her thumb up while trying his best to look happy. In reality, he was not.
He sat down next to another person. This person looked identical to Teardrop, although with a slightly darker tint, closer to Royal Blue.
"Wanna watch something on the TV together?" Teardrops exclaims her limited excitement with a silent nod.
"Okay, here you go." The other person hands him the remote. Teardrop carefully takes it and starts to switch around for a few minutes before settling on something.

Around fifteen minutes pass, when the other person said: "Oops, gotta go for night shift. See you." They leave the house.
Teardrop watches TV as the time passes. 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, a day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days... she knew that he sometimes inexplicably disappeared, but for 4 days?
Despite this, Teardrop kept watching. 1 week, 2 weeks... when is he returning?

After 27 days, Teardrops hears a knock on the door.
Was it law enforcement, looking for his roommate?
Was it the local community, worring about his wellbeing after watching TV for 4 weeks straight?
Or was it a friend of theirs coming for their monthly visit?
Either way, he rushed to the door to open it. None other than his roommate was standing in front of him.
Filled with joy, Teardrop intensively hugs his roommate, trying to express his worry about him in a non-verbal way.
But he remained silent. Something about this felt wrong.

Eventually, his roommate handed Teardrop a note. With visible confusion, Teardrop carefully unfolded the note. It's contents shook Teardrop to the core.
"I CAN'T TALK ANYMORE"
Teardrop was frozen with fright. He fell into the same fate as herself. Losing their channel to the outside world. Teardrop became furious. 
Surely, 27 days of radio silence followed by a changed man wasn't decided by fate. He stormed off into the back of his house.</pre>
