<div class="content">
  <pre>The sun is slowly awakening from its slumber.
It first lights up the distant hills, then the ground in front of the hills, and eventually the sun shines wide open into the fields.
Or, at least, what used to be the fields.

The Plains, located in the southern region of Goiky, has been left a giant wasteland.
All landmarks of the area, the Bathrooms, the local Steakhouse, the Swings, pretty much every structure that was here at some point is crumbling apart, and in some occasions, reduced into nothing but a pile of rubble.
The only thing remaining is a digitized metal sign, which conveys the following message.

"If anyone sees this sign after the events passing here, you are miles too late. Something catastrophic is taking place. You can't stop whatever has began. Not them, at least."
The sign also provides a regularly updating counter, indicating how many years this sign has been standing. It's count is 741.
What happened in order for this region to be abandoned for the rest of time?

At night, a figure approaches the sign. They plug a metal rod into the ground.
They unpack their backpack. Proceeding this, an image of the Plains in its normal state was hung up onto the rod. The figure wrote the year "2022" on it.
They also proceed to attach a sticky note to the image. Written on it: "REST WELL..."
Shortly after, an image of a familiar person was stuck underneath the sticky note. The text on the image header? "Liy".
After a pause, the figure crosses out the image of this person.
All visual evidence beyond this point has been ridden from history.</pre>
