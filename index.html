<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 1 - REASON STARTS WITH T</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>The sun is slowly awakening from its slumber.
It first lights up the distant hills, then the ground in front of the hills, and eventually the sun shines wide open into the fields.
Or, at least, what used to be the fields.

The Plains, located in the southern region of Goiky, is now a giant wasteland, due to an event in the past.
All landmarks of the area, the Bathrooms, the local Steakhouse, the Swings,
pretty much every structure that was here at some point is crumbling apart, and in some occasions, reduced into nothing but a pile of rubble.
The only thing remaining is a digitized metal sign, which conveys the following message:

"If anyone sees this sign after the events passing here, you are miles too late. Something catastrophic is taking place. You can't stop this. Not them, at least."
The sign also provides a regularly updating counter, indicating how many years this sign has been standing. Its count is 741.
What happened in order for this region to be abandoned for the rest of time?

At night, a figure approaches the sign. They plug a metal rod into the ground.
They unpack their backpack. Proceeding this, an image of the Plains in its normal state was hung up onto the rod. The figure wrote the year "2022" on it.
They also proceed to attach a sticky note to the image. Written on it: "REST WELL..."
Shortly after, an image of a familiar person was stuck underneath the sticky note. The text on the image header? "Liy".
After a pause, the figure crosses out the image of this person.
All visual evidence beyond this point has been ridden from history. Even after over 700 years of intensive investigation, nothing was ever found.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 1</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Poof. Wide awake. The first thing you see with your open eyes is the crown of an oak tree.
As you slowly lift up your body, you see the crowd, consisting of your fellow competitors.
They are having a good time, talking, laughing, doing all sorts of shenanigans.
You can't help but notice the weird situation you are in. A few give you a happy wave, most don't do anything, and the other few turn away.

As you run towards the bathrooms, you see someone walking off to the desert. "Eh, I guess they're going home early.", you think to yourself.
You really might want to do a bathroom break. You go in, and close the door.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 2 - ORDINARY DAY OF A VENGEFUL PERSON</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Teardrop. A lonely man with a feel of unfulfilledness. Walking down a desert path, all by himself. On, and on.
She doesn't find this path very exhausting, as she is used to walking this far for a long time. It takes him until dawn to reach a small house. He unlocks the door.

"Hey Tracy. How was it with the others?" a voice exclaimed. All that Teardrop did was hold her thumb up while trying her best to look happy. In reality, she was not.
She sat down next to another person. This person looked identical to Teardrop, although with a slightly darker tint, closer to a royal blue color.
"Wanna watch something on the TV together?" Teardrops exclaims her limited, but present excitement with a silent nod.
"Okay, here you go." The other person hands him the remote. Teardrop carefully takes it and starts to switch around for a few minutes before settling on something.

Around fifteen minutes pass, when the other person said: "Oops, gotta go for night shift. See you." They leave the house.
Teardrop watches TV as the time passes. 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, a day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days... she knew that he sometimes inexplicably disappeared, but for 4 days?
Despite this, Teardrop kept watching. 1 week, 2 weeks... when is he returning?

After 27 days, Teardrops hears a knock on the door.
Was it law enforcement, looking for her roommate?
Was it the local community, worring about her wellbeing after watching TV for 4 weeks straight?
Or was it a friend of theirs coming for their monthly visit?
Either way, she rushed to the door to open it. None other than her roommate was standing in front of her.
Filled with joy, Teardrop intensively hugs his roommate, trying to express her worry about him in a non-verbal way.
But he remained silent. This felt wrong. Her roommate was always eager to talk, so why is he not doing it today?

Eventually, his roommate handed Teardrop a note. With visible confusion, Teardrop carefully unfolded the note. It's contents shook Teardrop to the core.
"I CAN'T TALK ANYMORE"
Teardrop was frozen with fright. He fell into the same fate as herself. Losing their channel to the outside world. Teardrop became furious. 
Surely, 27 days of radio silence followed by a changed man wasn't decided by fate. She stormed off into the back of their house.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 2</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>You make your way out of the bathroom. All conversations continue as usual.
You overhear a conversation between Remote and Tree.

"Where do you think Teardrop has been?" Remote asks.
"I haven't got the slightest idea. She's been gone for quite a while now."
"Well, whatever it is, I very much hope she returns soon, We were trying to visit him a couple of hours ago, but nobody answered."
"Perhaps you got the wrong house?"
"Not a doubt that it is the right house. That was the only house in the region. I'm worried about her."
Tree rolls his eyes. "Well, what's gonna happen anyway? Her going rogue? Destroying the world like an evil villain? I don't think it's THAT big of a deal."
"Hmmmm.... maybe you're right."

Past this point, the conversation becomes no longer telligible.
You close your eyes.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 3 - IGNITION</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>A room. Darkness. Filled with secrets, this unknown location foresees dark intentions.
A corkboard wall, for planning out malicious actions. A box with supplies, for the usage of the corkboard wall. One could only imagine the things that happen in these four walls.
Someone enters the room. They have a few things with them. It seems to be heavy... but they don't seem to struggle with the weight.
Before loading off the supplies, an object is placed on the table. Oddly enough, it has a glowing face on it.
The looks of it alone are enough to strike fear into someones eyes.

The figure loads off the batch of things. Looks like... syringes? On top of that, they're filled with a clear substance.
A note is placed next to these syringes. Written on it is "TRANQ".
This figure starts building the plan. They lay out image cards of all locals around the Plains. Slowly, but surely, they figure out how they are connected. 

A particular shape starts to form. 3 circles. Seemingly a hierarchy.
The first and biggest circled was coined "OBSERVANTS": their job was to oversee and notify higher-ups if something goes wrong.
The second, slightly smaller circle, was named "OVERSEERS". Their job? Recieve from the observants and discuss matters with the last one in line.
The "EXECUTIVE". They decide on how to act.
The figure starts to pick apart who is in what group.
An hour quickly turns into two. Two turn into three and three eventually turn into four.
Only one person was not inserted yet. They proceed to insert this person. The name written on the image card is "Liy".
The unknown person slams their desk fiercely. Quickly after, the image of the Executive, Liy, was circled in. Their sights are set.

"I WILL BE SEEING YOU", they wrote.
This is the ignition. Only time will tell what happens next.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 3</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>You open your eyes again.
All it was, was a blink. Yet, it felt incredibly long.
Everything you saw before is still there, where it was before you closed your eyes. Certainly an odd experience...
You make your way into an area distant from the crowd. It's filled with bushes and also houses a tree in the center.
As you reach the tree, you lean against it and slowly sit down.
You feel like nothing else matters in the world as you slowly sink down and relax...
What a beautiful world it really is...
...
Suddenly, your head violently shakes forward. A sharp pain radiates through your neck. Have your sins caught up to you?
You touch around your neck to find the source of the pain. You feel something. A shockwave of pain is triggered.
Found it. You proceed to remove the long object from your neck.
It's... a syringe of some sort? You immediately realize. Something has gone terribly wrong.
You try to run, but as you stand up, your vision becomes woozy. You know now that you can't escape your fate. You slowly become more disoriented over time, until...
...
Lights out.
The last thing you notice before you wake up again is the sound of you being dragged around and the sound of a door being opened and promptly closed.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 4 - SINISTER MYSTERIES</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>As you slowly get back to yourself, you notice something. You are in a room. But where is this room? Who's room is this?
You were immediately scared by this revelation and try to run. However, your arms, legs and body are tied to the chair you are now sitting on. No chance for escape.
You are trapped in somebody's room, and you aren't even sure why you're here.
As your vision starts to return, you notice something on the walls.
Sticky notes. Quite a lot of sticky notes. All of them have crude writing on them.
"RESISTING DOESNT HELP".
"COOPERATE".
"TALK TO ME".
"YOU MIGHT SURVIVE".
With who are you supposed to talk or cooperate? Since when was survival based off of pure chance?
These are the questions running through your mind as you try to process all of the information around you.
"I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE".
"DONT LIE".
You aren't sure what they are talking about. Your nerves are bulilding up like never before. You feel like you're about to pass out again.
"SNITCHES GET STITCHES".
"DONT GET SCARED".
Am I going insane? Is this real? Am I dreaming? Is this a bad joke?
As you're contemplating what to do, the door opens. Very slowly. You see a shadowy figure enter.
As the door opens further, you start to recognize the person standing in front of you.
...
You can't believe your eyes. The person perpetrating all of this madness, one, silent woman?
Teardrop stands in the doorframe and holds an image. This is the person she was looking for.
It's the Executive. Indeed.

Teardrop closes the door as she approaches Liy. "Wh-. What do you want from me??" she hastily questions.
Teardrop doesn't respond. Liy screams in fear. "WHAT DO YOU WANT???"
Teardrop points at numerous sticky notes to explain her reasoning behind this.
"HIERARCHY".
"EXECUTOR".
The image of Liy, marked as the executor.
"ANSWERS".
Liy holds shut. "You're not getting answers from me. What are you trying to achieve?"
Teardrop, looking not very surprised, pulls it out. 

<img src="image-resources/Broken up into Tears - its released2.png" width="640" height="360">
image illustration by neosrc, image submission #1

The glowing face. It's a laser pistol. Used to obliterate anyone on contact.
Liy gulps. Frozen with existential fear. Survival really isn't taken for granted. At least here.
She can't even formulate a sentence anymore.
"ANSWERS".
"YOU MIGHT SURVIVE".
She rests her case. "You won't be told a thing. There is no such hierarchy."
Teardrop rolls her eyes. She points at "DON'T LIE".
"I- I'm not lying! Stop this ridiculousness!" Liy is shaking intensely.
Teardrop becomes angry and holds the laser pistol straight to her face.
"YOU ARE NOT GETTING ANYTHING FROM ME! NOT IN THIS WORLD!" Liy refuses to speak up. Not even for a second.
Teardrop, seeing no other choice, whacks Liy over the head with the pistol. A painful scream is heard.
"STOP THAT! YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING THAT WAY EITHER!"

This continues for a while. Quite a while. Two shots are heard inside the room.
After 30 minutes of intense interrogation, Liy is all bruised up. Blood stains, cuts, even multiple lacerations are visible.
"Please.. just leave me alone.." she pleaded. Merciless eyes have been staring at her for what felt like forever without an end in sight.
Teardrop looks at her notepad. Nothing. Not even one piece of information given. She throws the notepad at Liy and storms off.
She notices. Clear path, no obstacles, no Teardrop in sight. Now is the time.

Meanwhile, Teardrop goes back into her room, angry about the unsuccessful interrogation.
After reconsidering what to do from this point on, she walks over to the corkboard wall.
She takes out her marker, and draws a dot into the middle of Liy's image.
</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 4</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Escape. Freedom. At last.
You are currently running away as fast as you can from Teardrop's house, even though you are still bound up.
However, in the scuffle of the interrogation, the ropes tying your feet together have loosened.
After 25 minutes of non-stop running, you make it to the plains. It's early morning.
The locals just got out of bed and are heading towards the community area for their usual fun day.
As you arrive at the community center just before anyone else, you lay on the ground, exhausted.
All attention is on you. Every one of the locals start gathering around you in disbelief.
You inhale deeply, and...
..everything went dark.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 5 - COMPUTE AND EXECUTE</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>The glowing face. On the table. Dormant as ever.
Teardrop has now set Liy as her prime target. "IMMINENT".
The syringes with the label "TRANQ" are still on the table, the way she left them. Only one was missing.
Teardrop enters the room with another box of unnamed supplies in her hands. This one seems heavy.

Thud. The supplies are now on the table. She opens it to unpack... scrap metal? However, hidden within the pile is a blueprint.
A six-chambered weapon that fires off syringes, filled with... whatever she prefers to fill them with. It's labeled "Revolving Tranquilizer Cannon".
Teardrop, fueled with pure vitriol, started constructing this makeshift weapon.
30 minutes pass... then 60 minutes... 90 minutes... eventually, the RTC was constructed.
But, she needed to test it before using it. She had an idea. The RTC was loaded with an empty syringe.
She flicked the weapon and shot.

Spot on. Liy's image now had a syringe stuck to it. Dead in the center of the target shaped markings.
It worked. It worked very well. She proceeded to fill the weapon with 6 of the "TRANQ" syringes.
But one thing still needed to be taken care of. In a swift motion, the laser gun was no longer on the table.

A shot commences. Silence. Then another one is heard. And again, and again, and again. Then another one still. The chambers were all empty.
Teardrop had all 6 of them down. But again, there still was a prime target among them.
She aimed her laser pistol, rested her finger on the trigger...

<img src="image-resources/Broken up into Tears - illustration 2, without logo for site use.png" width="640" height="360">

Click. Darkness.
Done.

Teardrop re-enters her room. Silent as always.
The laser pistol is laid down on the table, exactly how it was before. Its eyes being just as merciless as they always were.
The RTC was thrown into a corner. It's apparent by this ruthless action that she no longer needs use of the weapon.
Back to the cork wall it was. This time, she knew exactly what to do.
Liy was crossed out. The side note? "DON'T LET YOUR PAST CATCH UP".
Her prime target has been dealt with.
However, she is far from done.
A new circle appears.
This time, it's their turn. The Overseers.
"INTERROGATION". Everything was about to be uncovered. At least, she thought.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">INBETWEENER 5</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Chaos. There is only one word to describe the state of southern Goiky.
Chaos. The locals are in a shared state of panic, as they notice 8 of the 64 residents are gone without a trace left behind.
The recovery centers were gone. Someone deleted them all. The only one who might know how to build one? Not present.
TV plays a loud alarm, trying to inform every citizen about the catastrophic state of the area..
Roboty repeats the Morse Code SOS signal.
Remote repeats two oscillating tones, similar to an AlertReady tone.
There is no better way to describe everything happening in this area, other than chaos.
Something has gone catastrophically wrong.
This is beyond their control. 1/8 of the locals disappearing, almost like they dissolved into thin air.
This is nothing that they can handle by themselves. They make their escape over the Goiky Canal.
Southern Goiky is now empty. Well, almost...</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 6 - INCOMPLETION</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Four doors. Labeled. Overseers.
Teardrop has acquired all of them in one felt swoop.
She is preparing to interrogate every one of them, to find out more about this hierarchy, now falling apart due to it missing it's strongest link.
Door One.
These were important to capture. Without them sitting in this room, her plan might have failed. The recovery centers had to be kept out of public hands.
A pair of sports balls sat in front of Teardrop. Teardrop, of course, was wielding her trusty sidearm.
"Why are you here?" Golf Ball exclaims her confusion. Tennis Ball was too traumatized to ask any questions himself.
The door slams shut. Teardrop had no time to waste. She points at the same note every time.
"ANSWERS". This is what Teardrop was looking for.
"Don't be unreasonable!"
Don't be unreasonable. Teardrop knew the answer to this.
"SOMETIMES, REASONABLE PEOPLE NEED TO DO UNREASONABLE THINGS".
A simple, yet incredibly effective answer.
She tried to further extort them.
...
No dice.
She clears the room.
She leaves.

Door Two.
Equally as important as Golf Ball and Tennis Ball. The next best engineer among the locals.
An orange ball with a black-striped pattern. Sitting in the same situation as the ones before her.
"What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?" Loudly spoken from Basketball.
Again, Teardrop wanted it to be over with quickly.
"ANSWERS".
"We don't have answers. Why us?"
Teardrop, hearing this question, was unsurprised as ever. She points at another sticky note.
"I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU HAVE VITAL INFORMATION. INFORMATION I NEED."
More extortion attempts.
No more information recieved.
Room empty.

Door Three.
Even if less important than engineers, these still pose a threat. Two people, creative minds, diverse uses, colors of opposition.
Resourcefulness was not the thing Teardrop was here for, however.
"What have we done wrong?" Stapy tries to justify why he isn't responsible.
Unfazed. Teardrop was getting tired. The gun is pulled.
"ANSWERS". No more games were being played. She wanted it now.
"Please spare us!" Foldy exclaimed with fear.
This was not an option for Teardrop to accept.
"NO ONE IS WAITING FOR YOU OUTSIDE OF THESE DOORS. EVERYONE ELSE HAS LEFT."
Cold. Just like this room is.
Extensive interrogation.
No results.
Deleted.

Teardrop now heads to the last door.
Inside this very door is the Overseer's "heavy lifter". Strong and disregarding of other people.
Teardrop had no interest in how strong he was. Neither physically, nor mentally.
"Why have you done this?" Snowball sternly exclaims.
Teardrop points.
"THAT IS NOT THE FOCUS OF THIS CONVERSATION".
"ANSWERS. NOW."
"Why, out of all people, was it her?"
Funny question. Why Liy? Why not anyone else in this world?
But Teardrop knows why she is doing this. She already knew it since the beginning of her plan.
"SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY TERRIBLE LIFE. I KNOW SHE IS. BUT HOW SHE MANAGED IT IS STILL MY CONCERN!"
Teardrop tries to get the last clue.
Snowball refuses to talk a word.
Cold. And that's not the room that's cold. It was Snowball, metaphorically.

Teardrop got everything she could.
She enters her room and sits down at her cork wall. The notes concluding her interrogations are laid onto the table in front of her.
The hierarchy was destroyed. She disassembled the original plan containing it.
Now, she tried to figure out the chronological happenstance of events with the last few notes she collected.
2 days.
6 days.
3 weeks.
5 weeks.
7 weeks.
The last time she changed the plan was 63 days after initally beginning to reassemble the cork wall.
Teardrop was unsuccessful. Her plan didn't achieve the intended result and now she was stuck, trying to figure out the last clues.
But she couldn't go back. You can't reverse death. At least not anymore.
Teardrop slowly let her head drift off, which at some point, gently hits the table. Perhaps she really needed a break...</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 7 - COLD CASE</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Teardrop's head rises as the sun rises from its sleep.
She realized that her plan went off-course and decided that it wasn't worth continuing the madness that she had planned.
She slowly, but surely, disassembles her cork wall.
Piece by piece, the wall falls apart in front of her very own eyes.
But she noticed something as she was about to finish disassembling the cork wall. A biking trail.
By some chance, she managed to accidentally draw a line onto the image while circling the Overseers, connecting two of the trees in the image.
Teardrop was shook. She started to panic, and then, out of nowhere...
...
Flashback.</pre>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SEGMENT 8 - PAST = PERSONALITY</button>
<div class="content">
<pre>Teardrop. A bike. A trail.
In this flashback of hers, she was riding her bike. Something that used to be one of her primary hobbies.
It all seemed to go too well.
Her flashback started to jump back and forth as she was slowly entering a panic attack.
She drove into a metal line maliciously set up to prevent any speedsters from riding down this trail.
Teardrop tried to slow herself down...
...but her efforts were of no use. The line caught Teardrop by the neck.
She was severly injured, and only made it out alive with a stroke of luck. But, before she was about to go unconscious. She saw a woman. A blueish colored woman.

It was her. No one else than the Executor herself, Liy, stood in front of her with a mischievous grin.
Teardrop knew it all along. Liy was responsible for the accident that caused her to lose her voice and nearly caused her death.
Her flashback started to subside and she was slowly entering reality again.
But before she was able to regain composure, Teardrop glimpsed at her roommate's note.
"I CAN'T TALK ANYMORE".
I can't talk anymore. It seemed too familiar to Teardrop. This might not be just a coincidence...
She was thrown back into her flashback.

This time, however, she was standing beside the line, watching her roommate fall to the same fate as her.
As before, it caught him by the neck and he barely survived. But she notices something.
As she would have expected it already, Liy was present. But who else was present? Everyone. Everyone except for Teardrop.
No one did anything to stop it. A few even cheered it on. This was unacceptable.
She couldn't believe the revelation she just went through. Everyone, even her closest friends of the local group.
They were all in on it. They all wanted to see her suffer. Eternally.
Teardrop snaps back out of the flashback.
Her expression of fear and shock slowly turned into one of pure anger.
In one motion, the corkboard's contents were ripped off. Teardrop proceeded to place a single note in the middle of the massive corkboard..
"TARGET: EVERYONE". Circled in.
The past foresees someones personality. And the one person who this applied to the most, was Teardrop.

"If anyone sees this sign after the events passing here, you are miles too late. Something catastrophic is taking place. You can't stop whatever has began. Not them, at least."
